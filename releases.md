**2.0.0**: This release is a major overhaul of `hocuspocus`.  In addition to managing any well-formed XML, it adds support for managing archives of local files formatted as "bland markdown", in OHCO2 eXchange Format, or in a delimited text file an ordered list of pairings of URNs and text contents.  Configuration has been greatly simplified, and is now cleanly separated into a text inventory cataloging how texts are identified and cited, and a text configuration file providing information about document formats and local file names.

**1.1.0**: adds `turtleizeRepository()` method to `Corpus` class

**1.0.0**: initial public release.
