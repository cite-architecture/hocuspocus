`hocuspocus` is a system for managing a corpus of citable texts. It is implemented in groovy, and uses gradle for its build system. You can retrieve binary jars, and zip files with source and documentation directly from the Nexus reposistory at <http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/nexus> or by using the maven coordinates group `edu.holycross.shot`, name `hocuspocus`.

Specifications for the library are being written using [concordion](http://concordion.org) to specify tests.  The output of testing these specifications is included [here](specs/hocuspocus/Hocuspocus.html).

Initial documentation is available [here](docs).
