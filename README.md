# hocuspocus#

`hocuspocus` is a system for managing a corpus of citable texts following the OHCO2 model, and stored in local files.  The files can be structured in XML, Markdown, two-column delimited text (URN-text content), or the OHCO2 eXchange Format (82XF).  

Using `hocuspocus`, you can convert texts to OHCO2-equivalent tabular representations in delimited-text formats (2-column delimited, 82XF, or the `cs2` library's internal 7-column format), and to OHCO2-equivalent representations as directed graphs expressed in RDF.  Delimited-text formats are suitable for a wide range of analytical applications;  RDF graphs can be directly imported into a SPARQL endpoint to provide a complete CTS  service with the `cs2` webapp.
