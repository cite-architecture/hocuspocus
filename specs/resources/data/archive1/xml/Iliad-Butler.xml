                    Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a
                    brave soul [<term xml:lang="xgreek">psukhē</term>] did it send hurrying down to
                    Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs </p>

                <p n="5" synch="5-9">and vultures, for so was the will of Zeus fulfilled from the day on which
                    the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one
                    another. And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the
                    son of Zeus and Leto; for he was angry with the king </p>

                <p n="10" synch="10-14">and sent a pestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son
                    of Atreus had dishonored Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships
                    of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom:
                    moreover he bore in his hand the scepter of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant's
                    wreath </p>

                <p n="15" synch="15-19">and he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who
                    were their chiefs. "Sons of Atreus," he cried, "and all other Achaeans, may the
                    gods who dwell in <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> grant you to
                    sack the city of Priam, and to reach your homes in safety; </p>

                <p n="1" synch="1-4">Now the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept soundly, but
                    Zeus was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honor to Achilles, and destroyed
                    many people at the ships of the Achaeans. </p>

                <p n="5" synch="5-9">In the end he deemed it would be best to send a lying dream to King
                    Agamemnon; so he called one to him and said to it, "Lying Dream, go to the ships
                    of the Achaeans, </p>

                <p n="10" synch="10-14">into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to him word to word as I now bid you.
                    Tell him to get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for he shall take <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. There are no longer divided counsels
                    among the gods; </p>

                <p n="15" synch="15-19">Hera has brought them to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans." The
                    dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached the ships of the
                    Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found him in his tent, wrapped
                    in a profound slumber. </p>

                <p n="20" synch="20-24">It hovered over his head in the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom
                    Agamemnon honored above all his councilors, and said: - "You are sleeping, son
                    of Atreus; </p>
