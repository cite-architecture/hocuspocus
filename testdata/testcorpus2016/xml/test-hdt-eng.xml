                 <div type="chapter" n="0"> 
                     <p> This is the Showing forth of the Inquiry of Herodotus of Halicarnassos , to
                        the end that neither the deeds of men may be forgotten by lapse of time , nor
                        the works great and marvellous , which have been produced some by Hellenes
                        and some by Barbarians , may lose their renown ; and especially that the
                        causes may be remembered for which these waged war with one another . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="1"> 
                     <p> Those of the Persians who have knowledge of history declare that the
                        Phenicians first began the quarrel . These , they say , came from that which is
                        called the Erythraian Sea to this of ours ; and having settled in the land
                        where they continue even now to dwell , set themselves forthwith to make long
                        voyages by sea . And conveying merchandise of Egypt and of Assyria they
                        arrived at other places and also at Argos ; now Argos was at that time in all
                        points the first of the States within that land which is now called
                        Hellas ; — the Phenicians arrived then at this land of Argos , and began to
                        dispose of their ship's cargo : and on the fifth or sixth day after they had
                        arrived , when their goods had been almost all sold , there came down to the
                        sea a great company of women , and among them the daughter of the king ; and
                        her name , as the Hellenes also agree , was Io the daughter of Inachos . These
                        standing near to the stern of the ship were buying of the wares such as
                        pleased them most , when of a sudden the Phenicians , passing the word from
                        one to another , made a rush upon them ; and the greater part of the women
                        escaped by flight , but Io and certain others were carried off . So they put
                        them on board their ship , and forthwith departed , sailing away to Egypt . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="2"> 
                     <p> In this manner the Persians report that Io came to Egypt , not agreeing
                        therein with the Hellenes , and this they say was the first beginning of
                        wrongs . Then after this , they say , certain Hellenes  (but the name of the
                        people they are not able to report ) put in to the city of Tyre in Phenicia
                        and carried off the king's daughter Europa ; — these would doubtless be
                        Cretans ; — and so they were quits for the former injury . After this however
                        the Hellenes , they say , were the authors of the second wrong ; for they
                        sailed in to Aia of Colchis and to the river Phasis with a ship of war , and
                        from thence , after they had done the other business for which they came ,
                        they carried off the king's daughter Medea : and the king of Colchis sent a
                        herald to the land of Hellas and demanded satisfaction for the rape and to
                        have his daughter back ; but they answered that , as the Barbarians had given
                        them no satisfaction for the rape of Io the Argive , so neither would they
                        give satisfaction to the Barbarians for this . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="3"> 
                     <p> In the next generation after this , they say , Alexander the son of Priam ,
                        having heard of these things , desired to get a wife for himself by violence
                        from Hellas , being fully assured that he would not be compelled to give any
                        satisfaction for this wrong , inasmuch as the Hellenes gave none for theirs .
                        So he carried off Helen , and the Hellenes resolved to send messengers first
                        and to demand her back with satisfaction for the rape ; and when they put
                        forth this demand , the others alleged to them the rape of Medea , saying that
                        the Hellenes were now desiring satisfaction to be given to them by others ,
                        though they had given none themselves nor had surrendered the person when
                        demand was made . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="4"> 
                     <p> Up to this point , they say , nothing more happened than the carrying away of
                        women on both sides ; but after this the Hellenes were very greatly to blame ;
                        for they set the first example of war , making an expedition into Asia before
                        the Barbarians made any into Europe . Now they say that in their judgment ,
                        though it is an act of wrong to carry away women by force , it is a folly to
                        set one's heart on taking vengeance for their rape , and the wise course is
                        to pay no regard when they have been carried away ; for it is evident that
                        they would never be carried away if they were not themselves willing to go .
                        And the Persians say that they , namely the people of Asia , when their women
                        were carried away by force , had made it a matter of no account , but the
                        Hellenes on account of a woman of Lacedemon gathered together a great
                        armament , and then came to Asia and destroyed the dominion of Priam ; and
                        that from this time forward they had always considered the Hellenic race to
                        be their enemy : for Asia and the Barbarian races which dwell there the
                        Persians claim as belonging to them ; but Europe and the Hellenic race they
                        consider to be parted off from them . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="5"> 
                     <p> The Persians for their part say that things happened thus ; and they conclude
                        that the beginning of their quarrel with the Hellenes was on account of the
                        taking of Ilion : but as regards Io the Phenicians do not agree with the
                        Persians in telling the tale thus ; for they deny that they carried her off
                        to Egypt by violent means , and they say on the other hand that when they
                        were in Argos she was intimate with the master of their ship , and perceiving
                        that she was with child , she was ashamed to confess it to her parents , and
                        therefore sailed away with the Phenicians of her own will , for fear of being
                        found out . These are the tales told by the Persians and the Phenicians
                        severally : and concerning these things I am not going to say that they
                        happened thus or thus , but when I have pointed to the man who first within
                        my own knowledge began to commit wrong against the Hellenes , I shall go
                        forward further with the story , giving an account of the cities of men ,
                        small as well as great : for those which in old times were great have for the
                        most part become small , while those that were in my own time great used in
                        former times to be small : so then , since I know that human prosperity never
                        continues steadfast , I shall make mention of both indifferently . </p>

                 <div type="chapter" n="6"> 
                     <p> Croesus was Lydian by race , the son of Alyattes and ruler of the nations
                        which dwell on this side of the river Halys ; which river , flowing from the
                        South between the Syrians and the Paphlagonians , runs out towards the North
                        Wind into that Sea which is called the Euxine . This Croesus , first of all
                        the Barbarians of whom we have knowledge , subdued certain of the Hellenes
                        and forced them to pay tribute , while others he gained over and made them
                        his friends . Those whom he subdued were the Ionians , the Aiolians , and the
                        Dorians who dwell in Asia ; and those whom he made his friends were the
                        Lacedemonians . But before the reign of Croesus all the Hellenes were free ;
                        for the expedition of the Kimmerians , which came upon Ionia before the time
                        of Croesus , was not a conquest of the cities but a plundering incursion
                        only . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="7"> 
                     <p> Now the supremacy which had belonged to the Heracleidai came to the family of
                        Croesus , called Mermnadai , in the following manner : — Candaules , whom the
                        Hellenes call Myrsilos , was ruler of Sardis and a descendant of Alcaios , son
                        of Heracles : for Agron , the son of Ninos , the son of Belos , the son of
                        Alcaios , was the first of the Heracleidai who became king of Sardis , and
                        Candaules the son of Myrsos was the last ; but those who were kings over this
                        land before Agrond , were descendants of Lydos the son of Atys , whence this
                        whole nation was called Lydian , having been before called Meonian . From
                        these the Heracleidai , descended from Heracles and the slave-girl of
                        Iardanos , obtained the government , being charged with it by reason of an
                        oracle ; and they reigned for two-and-twenty generations of men , five hundred
                        and five years , handing on the power from father to son , till the time of
                        Clandaules the son of Myrsos . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="8"> 
                     <p> This Candaules then of whom I speak had become passionately in love with his
                        own wife ; and having become so , he deemed that his wife was fairer by far
                        than all other women ; and thus deeming , to Gyges the son of Daskylos  (for he
                        of all his spearmen was the most pleasing to him ) , to this Gyges , I say , he
                        used to impart as well the more weighty of his affairs as also the beauty of
                        his wife , praising it above measure : and after no long time , since it was
                        destined that evil should happen to Candaules , he said to Gyges as follows :
                        "Gyges , I think that thou dost not believe me when I tell thee of the beauty
                        of my wife , for it happens that men's ears are less apt of belief than their
                        eyes : contrive therefore means by which thou mayest look upon her naked ."
                        But he cried aloud and said : "Master , what word of unwisdom is this which
                        thou dost utter , bidding me look upon my mistress naked ? When a woman puts
                        off her tunic she puts off her modesty also . Moreover of old time those fair
                        sayings have been found out by men , from which we ought to learn wisdom ; and
                        of these one is this , — that each man should look on his own : but I believe
                        indeed that she is of all women the fairest and I entreat thee not to ask of
                        me that which it is not lawful for me to do ." </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="9"> 
                     <p> With such words as these he resisted , fearing lest some evil might come to
                        him from this ; but the king answered him thus : "Be of good courage , Gyges ,
                        and have no fear , either of me , that I am saying these words to try thee , or
                        of my wife , lest any harm may happen to thee from her . For I will contrive
                        it so from the first that she shall not even perceive that she has been seen
                        by thee . I will place thee in the room where we sleep , behind the open door ;
                        and after I have gone in , my wife also will come to lie down . Now there is a
                        seat near the entrance of the room , and upon this she will lay her garments
                        as she takes them off one by one ; and so thou wilt be able to gaze upon her
                        at full leisure . And when she goes from the chair to the bed and thou shalt
                        be behind her back , then let it be thy part to take care that she sees thee
                        not as thou goest through the door ." </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="10"> 
                     <p> He then , since he might not avoid it , gave consent : and Candaules , when he
                        considered that it was time to rest , led Gyges to the chamber ; and
                        straightway after this the woman also appeared : and Gyges looked upon her
                        after she came in and as she laid down her garments ; and when she had her
                        back turned towards him , as she went to the bed , then he slipped away from
                        his hiding-place and was going forth . And as he went out , the woman caught
                        sight of him , and perceiving that which had been done by her husband she did
                        not cry out , though struck with shame , but she made as though she had not
                        perceived the matter , meaning to avenge herself upon Candaules : for among
                        the Lydians as also among most other Barbarians it is a shame even for a man
                        to be seen naked . </p>

                 <div type="chapter" n="1"> 
                     <p> When Cyrus had brought his life to an end , Cambyses received the royal power
                        in succession , being the son of Cyrus and of Cassandane the daughter of
                        Pharnaspes , for whose death , which came about before his own , Cyrus had made
                        great mourning himself and also had proclaimed to all those over whom he
                        bore rule that they should make mourning for her : Cambyses , I say , being the
                        son of this woman and of Cyrus , regarded the Ionians and Aiolians as slaves
                        inherited from his father ; and he proceeded to march an army against Egypt ,
                        taking with him as helpers not only the other nations of which he was the
                        ruler , but also those of the Hellenes over whom he had power besides . </p>

                 <div type="chapter" n="2"> 
                     <p> Now the Egyptians , before the time when Psammetichos became king over them ,
                        were wont to suppose that they had come into being first of all men ; but
                        since the time when Psammetichos having become king desired to know what men
                        had come into being first , they suppose that the Phrygians came into being
                        before themselves , but they themselves before all other men . Now
                        Psammetichos , when he was not able by inquiry to find out any means of
                        knowing who had come into being first of all men , contrived a device of the
                        following kind : — Taking two new- born children belonging to persons of the
                        common sort he gave them to a shepherd to bring up at the place where his
                        flocks were , with a manner of bringing up such as I shall say , charging him
                        namely that no man should utter any word in their presence , and that they
                        should be placed by themselves in a room where none might come , and at the
                        proper time he should bring to them she-goats , and when he had satisfied
                        them with milk he should do for them whatever else was needed . These things
                        Psammetichos did and gave him this charge wishing to hear what word the
                        children would let break forth first , after they had ceased from wailings
                        without sense . And accordingly so it came to pass ; for after a space of two
                        years had gone by , during which the shepherd went on acting so , at length ,
                        when he opened the door and entered , both the children fell before him in
                        entreaty and uttered the word  <emph> bekos </emph>  , stretching forth their
                        hands . At first when he heard this the shepherd kept silence ; but since this
                        word was often repeated , as he visited them constantly and attended to them ,
                        at last he declared the matter to his master , and at his command he brought
                        the children before his face . Then Psammetichos having himself also heard
                        it , began to inquire about what nation of men named anything
                             <emph> bekos </emph>  , and inquiring he found that the Phrygians had this
                        name for bread . In this manner and guided by an indication such as this , the
                        Egyptians were brought to allow that the Phrygians were a more ancient
                        people than themselves . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="3"> 
                     <p> That so it came to pass I heard from the priests of that Hephaistos who
                        dwells at Memphis ; but the Hellenes relate , besides many other idle tales ,
                        that Psammetichos cut out the tongues of certain women , and then caused the
                        children to live with these women . With regard then to the rearing of the
                        children they related so much as I have said : and I heard also other things
                        at Memphis when I had speech with the priests of Hephaistos . Moreover I
                        visited both Thebes and Heliopolis for this very cause , namely because I
                        wished to know whether the priests at these places would agree in their
                        accounts with those at Memphis ; for the men of Heliopolis are said to be the
                        most learned in records of the Egyptians . Those of their narrations which I
                        heard with regard to the gods I am not earnest to relate in full , but I
                        shall name them only , because I consider that all men are equally ignorant
                        of these matters : and whatever things of them I may record , I shall record
                        only because I am compelled by the course of the story . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="4"> 
                     <p> But as to those matters which concern men , the priests agreed with one
                        another in saying that the Egyptians were the first of all men on earth to
                        find out the course of the year , having divided the seasons into twelve
                        parts to make up the whole ; and this they said they found out from the
                        stars : and they reckon to this extent more wisely than the Hellenes , as it
                        seems to me , inasmuch as the Hellenes throw in an intercalated month every
                        other year , to make the seasons right , whereas the Egyptians , reckoning the
                        twelve months at thirty days each , bring in also every year five days beyond
                        the number , and thus the circle of their seasons is completed and comes
                        round to the same point whence it set out . They said moreover that the
                        Egyptians were the first who brought into use appellations for the twelve
                        gods and the Hellenes took up the use from them ; and that they were the
                        first who assigned altars and images and temples to the gods , and who
                        engraved figures on stones ; and with regard to the greater number of these
                        things they showed me by actual facts that they had happened so . They said
                        also that the first man who became king of Egypt was Min ; and that in his
                        time all Egypt except the district of Thebes was a swamp , and none of the
                        regions were then above water which now lie below the lake of Moiris , to
                        which lake it is a voyage of seven days up the river from the sea : </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="5"> 
                     <p>  and I thought that they said well about the land ; for it is manifest in
                        truth even to a person who has not heard it beforehand but has only seen , at
                        least if he have understanding , that the Egypt to which the Hellenes come in
                        ships is a land which has been won by the Egyptians as an addition , and that
                        it is a gift of the river : moreover the regions which lie above this lake
                        also for a distance of three days' sail , about which they did not go on to
                        say anything of this kind , are nevertheless another instance of the same
                        thing : for the nature of the land of Egypt is as follows : —  First when you
                        are still approaching it in a ship and are distant a day's run from the
                        land , if you let down a sounding-line you will bring up mud and will find
                        yourself in eleven fathoms . This then so far shows that there is a silting
                        forward of the land . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="6"> 
                     <p> Then secondly , as to Egypt itself , the extent of it along the sea is sixty
                             <emph> schoines </emph>  , according to our definition of Egypt as extending
                        from the Gulf of Plinthine to the Serbonian lake , along which stretches
                        Mount Casion ; from this lake then the sixty  <emph> schoines </emph>  are
                        reckoned : for those of men who are poor in land have their country measured
                        by fathoms , those who are less poor by furlongs , those who have much land by
                        parasangs , and those who have land in very great abundance by
                             <emph> schoines </emph>  : now the parasang is equal to thirty furlongs , and
                        each  <emph> schoine </emph>  , which is an Egyptian measure , is equal to sixty
                        furlongs . So there would be an extent of three thousand six hundred furlongs
                        for the coast-land of Egypt . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="7"> 
                     <p> From thence and as far as Heliopolis inland Egypt is broad , and the land is
                        all flat and without springs of water and formed of mud : and the road as one
                        goes inland from the sea to Heliopolis is about the same in length as that
                        which leads from the altar of the twelve gods at Athens to Pisa and the
                        temple of Olympian Zeus : reckoning up you would find the difference very
                        small by which these roads fail of being equal in length , not more indeed
                        than fifteen furlongs ; for the road from Athens to Pisa wants fifteen
                        furlongs of being fifteen hundred , while the road to Heliopolis from the sea
                        reaches that number completely . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="8"> 
                     <p> From Heliopolis however , as you go up , Egypt is narrow ; for on the one side a
                        mountain-range belonging to Arabia stretches along by the side of it , going
                        in a direction from North towards the midday and the South Wind , tending
                        upwards without a break to that which is called the Erythraian Sea , in which
                        range are the stone-quarries which were used in cutting stone for the
                        pyramids at Memphis . On this side then the mountain ends where I have said ,
                        and then takes a turn back ; and where it is widest , as I was informed , it is
                        a journey of two months across from East to West ; and the borders of it
                        which turn towards the East are said to produce frankincense . Such then is
                        the nature of this mountain-range ; and on the side of Egypt towards Libya
                        another range extends , rocky and enveloped in sand : in this are the
                        pyramids , and it runs in the same direction as those parts of the Arabian
                        mountains which go towards the midday . So then , I say , from Heliopolis the
                        land has no longer a great extent so far as it belongs to Egypt , and for
                        about four days' sail up the river Egypt properly so called is narrow : and
                        the space between the mountain-ranges which have been mentioned is
                        plain-land , but where it is narrowest it did not seem to me to exceed two
                        hundred furlongs from the Arabian mountains to those which are called the
                        Libyan . After this again Egypt is broad . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="9"> 
                     <p> Such is the nature of this land : and from Heliopolis to Thebes is a voyage up
                        the river of nine days , and the distance of the journey in furlongs is four
                        thousand eight hundred and sixty , the number of the  <emph> schoines </emph> 
                        being eighty-one . If these measures of Egypt in furlongs be put together the
                        result is as follows : — I have already before this shown that the distance
                        along the sea amounts to three thousand six hundred furlongs , and I will now
                        declare what the distance is inland from the sea to Thebes , namely six
                        thousand one hundred and twenty furlongs : and again the distance from Thebes
                        to the city called Elephantine is one thousand eight hundred furlongs . </p>

                     <p> Of this land then , concerning which I have spoken , it seemed to myself also ,
                        according as the priests said , that the greater part had been won as an
                        addition by the Egyptians ; for it was evident to me that the space between
                        the aforesaid mountain-ranges , which lie above the city of Memphis , once was
                        a gulf of the sea , like the regions about Ilion and Teuthrania and Ephesos
                        and the plain of the Maiander , if it be permitted to compare small things
                        with great ; and small these are in comparison , for of the rivers which
                        heaped up the soil in those regions none is worthy to be compared in volume
                        with a single one of the mouths of the Nile , which has five mouths . Moreover
                        there are other rivers also , not in size at all equal to the Nile , which
                        have performed great feats ; of which I can mention the names of several , and
                        especially the Achelo�s , which flowing through Acarnania and so issuing out
                        into the sea has already made half of the Echinades from islands into
                        mainland . </p>

                 <head> THE THIRD BOOK OF THE HISTORIES , CALLED THALEIA </head> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="1"> 
                     <p> Against this Amasis then Cambyses the son of Cyrus was making his march ,
                        taking with him not only other nations of which he was ruler , but also
                        Hellenes , both Ionians and Aiolians : and the cause of the expedition was as
                        follows : — Cambyses sent an envoy to Egypt and asked Amasis to give him his
                        daughter ; and he made the request by counsel of an Egyptian , who brought
                        this upon Amasis having a quarrel with him for the following reason : — at the
                        time when Cyrus sent to Amasis and asked him for a physician of the eyes ,
                        whosoever was the best of those in Egypt , Amasis had selected him from all
                        the physicians in Egypt and had torn him away from his wife and children and
                        delivered him up to Persia . Having , I say , this cause of quarrel , the
                        Egyptian urged Cambyses on by his counsel bidding him ask Amasis for his
                        daughter , in order that he might either be grieved if he gave her , or if he
                        refused to give her , might offend Cambyses . So Amasis , who was vexed by the
                        power of the Persians and afraid of it , knew neither how to give nor how to
                        refuse : for he was well assured that Cambyses did not intend to have her as
                        his wife but as a concubine . So making account of the matter thus , he did as
                        follows : — there was a daughter of Apries the former king , very tall and
                        comely of form and the only person left of his house , and her name was
                        Nitetis . This girl Amasis adorned with raiment and with gold , and sent her
                        away to Persia as his own daughter : but after a time , when Cambyses saluted
                        her calling her by the name of her father , the girl said to him : "O king ,
                        thou dost not perceive how thou hast been deceived by Amasis ; for he adorned
                        me with ornaments and sent me away giving me to thee as his own daughter ,
                        whereas in truth I am the daughter of Apries against whom Amasis rose up
                        with the Egyptians and murdered him , who was his lord and master ." These
                        words uttered and this occasion having arisen , led Cambyses the son of Cyrus
                        against Egypt , moved to very great anger . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="2"> 
                     <p> Such is the report made by the Persians ; but as for the Egyptians they claim
                        Cambyses as one of themselves , saying that he was born of this very daughter
                        of Apries ; for they say that Cyrus was he who sent to Amasis for his
                        daughter , and not Cambyses . In saying this however they say not rightly ; nor
                        can they have failed to observe  (for the Egyptians fully as well as any
                        other people are acquainted with the laws and customs of the Persians ) ,
                        first that it is not customary among them for a bastard to become king , when
                        there is a son born of a true marriage , and secondly that Cambyses was the
                        son of Cassandane the daughter of Pharnaspes , a man of the Achaimenid
                        family , and not the son of the Egyptian woman : but they pervert the truth of
                        history , claiming to be kindred with the house of Cyrus . Thus it is with
                        these matters ; </p>

                 <div type="chapter" n="3"> 
                     <p>  and the following story is also told , which for my part I do not believe ,
                        namely that one of the Persian women came in to the wives of Cyrus , and when
                        she saw standing by the side of Cassandane children comely of form and tall ,
                        she was loud in her praises of them , expressing great admiration ; and
                        Cassandane , who was the wife of Cyrus , spoke as follows : "Nevertheless ,
                        though I am the mother of such children of these , Cyrus treats me with
                        dishonour and holds in honour her whom he has brought in from Egypt ." Thus
                        she spoke , they say , being vexed by Nitetis , and upon that Cambyses the
                        elder of her sons said : "For this cause , mother , when I am grown to be a
                        man , I will make that which is above in Egypt to be below , and that which is
                        below above ." This he is reported to have said when he was perhaps about ten
                        years old , and the women were astonished by it : and he , they say , kept it
                        ever in mind , and so at last when he had become a man and had obtained the
                        royal power , he made the expedition against Egypt . </p>

                     <p> Another thing also contributed to this expedition , which was as
                        follows : — There was among the foreign mercenaries of Amasis a man who was by
                        race of Halicarnassos , and his name was Phanes , one who was both capable in
                        judgment and valiant in that which pertained to war . This Phanes , having  (as
                        we may suppose ) some quarrel with Amasis , fled away from Egypt in a ship ,
                        desiring to come to speech with Cambyses : and as he was of no small repute
                        among the mercenaries and was very closely acquainted with all the affairs
                        of Egypt , Amasis pursued him and considered it a matter of some moment to
                        capture him : and he pursued by sending after him the most trusted of his
                        eunuchs with a trireme , who captured him in Lykia ; but having captured him
                        he did not bring him back to Egypt , since Phanes got the better of him by
                        cunning ; for he made his guards drunk and escaped to Persia . So when
                        Cambyses had made his resolve to march upon Egypt , and was in difficulty
                        about the march , as to how he should get safely through the waterless
                        region , this man came to him and besides informing of the other matters of
                        Amasis , he instructed him also as to the march , advising him to send to the
                        king of the Arabians and ask that he would give him safety of passage
                        through this region . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="5"> 
                     <p> Now by this way only is there a known entrance to Egypt : for from Phenicia to
                        the borders of the city of Cadytis belongs to the Syrians who are called of
                        Palestine , and from Cadytis , which is a city I suppose not much less than
                        Sardis , from this city the trading stations on the sea- coast as far as the
                        city of Ienysos belong to the king of Arabia , and then from Ienysos again
                        the country belongs to the Syrians as far as the Serbonian lake , along the
                        side of which Mount Casion extends towards the Sea . After that , from the
                        Serbonian lake , in which the story goes that Typhon is concealed , from this
                        point onwards the land is Egypt . Now the region which lies between the city
                        of Ienysos on the one hand and Mount Casion and the Serbonian lake on the
                        other , which is of no small extent but as much as a three days' journey , is
                        grievously destitute of water . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="6"> 
                     <p> And one thing I shall tell of , which few of those who go in ships to Egypt
                        have observed , and it is this : —  into Egypt from all parts of Hellas and
                        also from Phenicia are brought twice every year earthenware jars full of
                        wine , and yet it may almost be said that you cannot see there one single
                        empty wine-jar . In what manner , then , it will be asked , are they used up ?
                        This also I will tell . The head-man of each place must collect all the
                        earthenware jars from his own town and convey them to Memphis , and those at
                        Memphis must fill them with water and convey them to these same waterless
                        regions of Syria : this the jars which come regularly to Egypt and are
                        emptied there , are carried to Syria to be added to that which has come
                        before . It was the Persians who thus prepared this approach to Egypt ,
                        furnishing it with water in the manner which has been said , from the time
                        when they first took possession of Egypt : but at the time of which I speak ,
                        seeing that water was not yet provided , Cambyses , in accordance with what he
                        was told by his Halicarnassian guest , sent envoys to the Arabian king and
                        from him asked and obtained the safe passage , having given him pledges of
                        friendship and received them from him in return . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="8"> 
                     <p> Now the Arabians have respect for pledges of friendship as much as those men
                        in all the world who regard them most ; and they give them in the following
                        manner : — A man different from those who desire to give the pledges to one
                        another , standing in the midst between the two , cuts with a sharp stone the
                        inner parts of the hands , along by the thumbs , of those who are giving the
                        pledges to one another , and then he takes a thread from the cloak of each
                        one and smears with the blood seven stones laid in the midst between them ;
                        and as he does this he calls upon Dionysos and Urania . When the man has
                        completed these ceremonies , he who has given the pledges commends to the
                        care of his friends the stranger  (or the fellow-tribesman , if he is giving
                        the pledges to one who is a member of his tribe ) , and the friends think it
                        right that they also should have regard for the pledges given . Of gods they
                        believe in Dionysos and Urania alone : moreover they say that the cutting of
                        their hair is done after the same fashion as that of Dionysos himself ; and
                        they cut their hair in a circle round , shaving away the hair of the temples .
                        Now they call Dionysos Orotalt and Urania they call Alilat . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="9"> 
                     <p> So then when the Arabian king had given the pledge of friendship to the men
                        who had come to him from Cambyses , he contrived as follows : —  he took skins
                        of camels and filled them with water and loaded them upon the backs of all
                        the living camels that he had ; and having so done he drove them to the
                        waterless region and there awaited the army of Cambyses . This which has been
                        related is the more credible of the accounts given , but the less credible
                        must also be related , since it is a current account . There is a great river
                        in Arabia called Corys , and this runs out into the Sea which is called
                        Erythraian . From this river then it is said that the king of the Arabians ,
                        having got a conduit pipe made by sewing together raw ox-hides and other
                        skins , of such a length as to reach to the waterless region , conducted the
                        water through these forsooth , and had great cisterns dug in the waterless
                        region , that they might receive the water and preserve it . Now it is a
                        journey of twelve days from the river to this waterless region ; and moreover
                        the story says that he conducted the water by three conduit-pipes to three
                        different parts of it . </p> 
                 </div> 
                 <div type="chapter" n="10"> 
                     <p> Meanwhile Psammenitos the son of Amasis was encamped at the Pelusian mouth of
                        the Nile waiting for the coming of Cambyses : for Cambyses did not find
                        Amasis yet living when he marched upon Egypt , but Amasis had died after
                        having reigned forty and four years during which no great misfortune had
                        befallen him : and when he had died and had been embalmed he was buried in
                        the burial-place in the temple , which he had built for himself . Now when
                        Psammenitos son of Amasis was reigning as king , there happened to the
                        Egyptians a prodigy , the greatest that had ever happened : for rain fell at
                        Thebes in Egypt , where never before had rain fallen nor afterwards down to
                        my time , as the Thebans themselves say ; for in the upper parts of Egypt no
                        rain falls at all : but at the time of which I speak rain fell at Thebes in a
                        drizzling shower . </p>
